For the continuation of this project, I needed to switch my country of choice because the data was too large for my computer to complete. I switched to the European nation of Slovakia. Below are the images from the first part of this module.

From this there was still a large importance on the ntl variable where it was significantly greater than the rest of the variables. Also, in the linear regression results, the line does a pretty good job of fitting the points. 

With the old stuff completed, the next model is worked on. This is where I was experiencing many issues, most notibly the error for vector size being too large. By using Slovakia instead of Nepal, a much smaller nation, the issues seemed to resolve themselves. After completing the code, the following was the image produced.
